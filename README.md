# Doggobase - The Dog Name Finder

The goal of this React application is to collect common Hungarian dog names from users and create a  database. This way users can search for names based on given characteristics such as gender, size, etc. or simply browse names. 
Logged in users can also add dogs with pictures and save their favourite dogs.

The backend was created with Express. js and data is stored in Cloud Firestore.

<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). -->

## To Run  App: 

In both 'frontend' and 'backend' folder, run: 

### `npm install`

In the 'backend' folder, to start the development server, run: 

### `npm run dev`

In the 'frontend' folder, to start React run: 

### `npm start`


<!-- Runs the app in the development mode.\ -->
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

<!-- The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
